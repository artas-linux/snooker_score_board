# Snooker Score Board Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Cross-Platform Consistency
All features must function identically across web and Android platforms, with UI adapting to platform-specific guidelines.

### II. Real-Time Performance
Score updates must reflect in the UI within 1 second of input to maintain game flow.

### III. Data Integrity
Game data must persist reliably and be recoverable in case of application crashes.

### IV. Century Break Focus
Century break detection and highlighting is the key differentiator and must be prioritized in UI/UX decisions.

### V. Intuitive Gameplay
Score input should be quick and error-resistant, allowing players to focus on the game.

## Development Standards

- UI components must be reusable and follow the defined theming system
- State management must use provider pattern with clear separation of concerns
- All major components must have unit and integration tests

## Governance
