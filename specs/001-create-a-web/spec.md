### User Story 2 - Real-time Score Tracking (Priority: P1)

During an active game, players need to input points scored for each turn, and the application should update the scores in real-time.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality for the scoreboard.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a game, entering scores for multiple players, and observing correct score updates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active game with Player A's turn, **When** Player A scores 20 points and inputs them, **Then** Player A's score is updated to 20, and it becomes the next player's turn.
2. **Given** an active game, **When** a player inputs a score, **Then** the total score for that player is immediately reflected on the scoreboard.

### User Story 3 - Century Break Detection & Highlight (Priority: P1)

The application must automatically detect and visually highlight when a player achieves a century break (100 or more points in a single turn).

**Why this priority**: This is a key differentiator and a core requirement from the user.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a game where a player scores 100+ points in a single turn, and verifying the visual highlight appears.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Player B's current score is 50, **When** Player B scores 60 points in a single turn, **Then** Player B's total score is 110, and a visual indicator for a century break is displayed next to Player B's name.
2. **Given** a player has achieved a century break, **When** the game progresses, **Then** the century break highlight remains visible until the end of the game.

---

### User Story 4 - End Game & View Results (Priority: P2)

After a game, users should be able to end the game and view the final scores, including who achieved century breaks.

**Why this priority**: Essential for completing a game and reviewing performance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by playing a game to completion, ending it, and verifying the final results display accurately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active game, **When** the user selects "End Game", **Then** the game concludes, and a summary screen displays final scores for all players.
2. **Given** a game summary screen, **When** a player achieved a century break during the game, **Then** the summary screen clearly indicates the century break achievement for that player.

---

### User Story 5 - Cross-Platform Access (Priority: P3)

Users should be able to access the scoreboard as a web application and a standalone Android application.

**Why this priority**: Broadens accessibility and user base.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by deploying the web application to a server and installing the Android APK on a device, then verifying basic functionality on both platforms.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a web browser, **When** the user navigates to the application URL, **Then** the snooker scoreboard web application loads and is fully functional.
2. **Given** an Android device, **When** the user installs the provided APK, **Then** the snooker scoreboard application launches and is fully functional on the device.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-13
- Q: How should score corrections be handled? → A: Manual score adjustment by admin/game creator
- Q: Should the system enforce 5-6 players, or allow flexibility? → A: Allow any number of players (2+)

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a player accidentally enters an incorrect score? The system should allow a manual score adjustment by the admin or game creator.
- How does the system handle more or fewer than 5-6 players? The system should allow any number of players (2+), and the application should be able to enter their names.
- What if no player achieves a century break? The system should simply not display any century break highlights or achievements in the final results.
