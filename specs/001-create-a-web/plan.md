# Implementation Plan: Snooker Score Board Application

**Branch**: `001-create-a-web` | **Date**: 2025-10-13 | **Spec**: /home/archbtw/dev/projects/snooker_score_board/specs/001-create-a-web/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-create-a-web/spec.md`

## Summary

Develop a cross-platform snooker scoreboard application for web and Android, enabling 2+ players to track scores in real-time, detect and highlight century breaks, and persist game history. The application will feature a professional, aesthetically pleasing UI with Flutter-based animations.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Flutter 3.16+ for cross-platform development
**Primary Dependencies**: Flutter SDK, provider package for state management, shared_preferences for data persistence
**Storage**: shared_preferences (web and Android)
**Testing**: Flutter testing framework, integration_test package
**Target Platform**: Web (Modern Browsers), Android (API 21+)
**Project Type**: Full-stack (Web + Mobile)
**Performance Goals**: Real-time score updates (<1s), Smooth UI animations (60fps)
**Constraints**: Cross-platform compatibility, Theming support (Catppuccin + Tokyo Night palette), Professional and aesthetically pleasing UI with Flutter-based animations.
**Scale/Scope**: Small to medium-sized games (2+ players), Historical game data for individual users

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **II. Cross-Platform Accessibility**: The plan explicitly targets web and Android platforms. (PASS)
- **III. Intuitive Score Tracking**: The plan emphasizes real-time, user-friendly score input and display. (PASS)
- **IV. Data Persistence**: The plan includes local storage for web and SQLite/Realm for Android to persist game data. (PASS)
- **V. Themable and Responsive UI**: The plan incorporates theming support and responsive design for a professional aesthetic. (PASS)
- **Technical Stack & Conventions**: The plan aligns with modern web technologies and cross-platform frameworks, considering the user's dotfiles context. (PASS)
- **Development & Release Workflow**: The plan will follow a feature-branch workflow with automated testing and semantic versioning. (PASS)

└── tests/
```

**Structure Decision**: The project will use a monorepo-like structure with a `shared/` directory for common logic, and separate `web/` and `android/` directories for platform-specific implementations. This allows for code reuse while accommodating platform-specific UI and integration needs.
