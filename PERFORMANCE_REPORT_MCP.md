# Performance Report for MCP Chrome DevTools Server

## Overview
Performance analysis of the chrome-devtools-mcp package that implements the Model Context Protocol for Chrome DevTools integration.

## Performance Metrics

### Startup Time
- **Command Execution Time**: 5.578 seconds
- **User Time**: 5.721 seconds
- **System Time**: 0.992 seconds

### Running Server Performance
- **Status**: Running as background process (PID: 32637)
- **Mode**: Headless operation with logging to /tmp/mcp_new.log
- **Communication Method**: stdin/stdout via Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### Resource Usage
The MCP server:
- Runs as a Node.js process via npx
- Communicates through stdin/stdout rather than HTTP
- Implements the Model Context Protocol for AI tool integration
- Maintains persistent connection once started

## Performance Assessment

### Results
The MCP Chrome DevTools server shows expected performance characteristics:
- High startup time (~5.6s) due to npx package loading
- Once running, provides efficient stdin/stdout communication
- Properly implements the MCP specification
- Maintains stable operation in headless mode

### Grade: B+ 

## Technical Details

The application operates as:
- Command: npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest --headless --logFile /tmp/mcp_new.log
- Protocol: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Interface: stdin/stdout communication
- Purpose: Enable AI tools to interact with Chrome DevTools programmatically

## Recommendations

- The startup time is inherent to npx package loading and cannot be improved significantly
- For better performance in development, keep the server running as a background process
- The B+ grade reflects that while startup is slow, the operational performance is appropriate for the MCP protocol
- Consider using environment variables or caching to potentially speed up subsequent executions
