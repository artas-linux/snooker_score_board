# Using Zen-MCP Server's Clink Tool for Snooker Score Board Analysis

This guide explains how to use the zen-mcp-server's clink tool to analyze the Snooker Score Board project for code relationships, dependencies, and potential improvements.

## What is Clink?

The "clink" tool in zen-mcp-server provides code linking and relationship analysis capabilities. It can:
- Map dependencies between different code components
- Identify code patterns and structures
- Analyze potential improvements
- Find related code fragments across the codebase

## Setting Up Clink for Snooker Score Board

The clink tool is already configured in the zen-mcp-server integration. To use it, ensure you have:

1. The zen-mcp-server running
2. Proper API keys configured in your environment
3. The .zen/project_config.json file with clink enabled

## Using Clink for Code Analysis

### 1. Dependency Analysis
To analyze dependencies within the Snooker Score Board project:

```bash
# Use zen-mcp-server to analyze dependencies
# Note: This requires the server to be running and connected via MCP protocol
```

### 2. Finding Related Code Components
Clink can identify how different parts of the Snooker Score Board are connected, such as:

- How `GameProvider` connects to UI components
- How `Player` model is used across different screens
- Relationships between score controls and game logic

### 3. Architecture Review
Use clink to understand the architecture of the Snooker Score Board:

- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) patterns
- State management with Provider
- UI component relationships

## Example Use Cases

### Analyzing Player Score Logic
The clink tool can trace how player scores are managed from UI input through to data storage:
- UI components: `SnookerScoreControls`, `ColorBallSelector`
- State management: `GameProvider`
- Data models: `Player`, `Game`
- Services: `GameService`, `GameStorageService`

### Understanding UI Component Relationships
Clink can map the relationships between different UI components:
- `GameBoardScreen` → `PlayerScoreCard` → `SnookerScoreControls`
- How animations are connected: `FlyingScoreAnimation`, `ScoreAnimationWidget`

### Identifying Potential Improvements
Clink analysis might reveal:
- Overly complex component relationships
- Missing architectural boundaries
- Opportunities for code reuse
- Performance bottlenecks

## Integration with Development Workflow

The zen-mcp-server clink tool can be integrated into the development workflow:

1. **Before implementing new features**, use clink to understand existing relationships
2. **During code reviews**, use clink to verify dependency changes
3. **For refactoring**, use clink to identify the impact of code changes
4. **For debugging**, use clink to trace unexpected behavior through the codebase

## Running Analysis

To perform clink analysis on the Snooker Score Board project (requires zen-mcp-server):

1. Ensure zen-mcp-server is running
2. Connect using an MCP-compatible client
3. Send a clink request specifying the project directory
4. Process the response with relationship data

Example conceptual request:
```
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "clink",
    "arguments": {
      "path": "/path/to/snooker_score_board",
      "operation": "analyze"
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits for Snooker Score Board Project

Using clink with the Snooker Score Board project provides:

- **Better understanding** of the codebase structure
- **Improved maintainability** through clear dependency visualization
- **Safer refactoring** with impact analysis
- **Faster onboarding** for new developers
- **Enhanced code quality** through relationship insights
