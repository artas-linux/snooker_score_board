# Complete MCP Chrome DevTools Performance Setup

## Current Status
âœ… All systems are now properly connected for performance checking!

### 1. Snooker Score Board Web App
- **URL**: http://localhost:8080
- **Status**: Running
- **Purpose**: Your Flutter web application

### 2. Chrome Browser with Remote Debugging
- **Debug URL**: ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/50b3e13e-b3c6-42c8-935c-aac4d6ed7363
- **Status**: Running with --remote-debugging-port=9222
- **Purpose**: Browser for testing with full DevTools access

### 3. MCP Chrome DevTools Server
- **Status**: Running and connected to Chrome (PID: 40217)
- **Command**: npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest --browserUrl http://127.0.0.1:9222
- **Purpose**: MCP interface for AI tools to interact with Chrome DevTools

### 4. Dart DevTools (Additional)
- **URL**: http://127.0.0.1:9100
- **Status**: Running
- **Purpose**: Dart/Flutter specific performance tools

## Performance Checking Process

With this setup, you can now perform performance checking via MCP:

1. **Navigate to your application**: MCP can programmatically navigate Chrome to http://localhost:8080
2. **Run performance audits**: Collect load times, rendering performance, resource usage
3. **Monitor network activity**: Analyze HTTP requests and responses
4. **Capture performance metrics**: Timing, memory usage, CPU load

## How MCP Interacts for Performance Checking

An MCP-compatible client would send commands like:

```json
{
  "method": "devtools/navigate",
  "params": {
    "url": "http://localhost:8080"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

To run performance audits, it could send:
```json
{
  "method": "devtools/performance/start",
  "params": {},
  "id": 2
}
```

## Verification

The setup is working because:
- Chrome is running with remote debugging enabled (port 9222)
- MCP server is connected to Chrome's debugging interface
- Your Snooker Score Board app is accessible at http://localhost:8080
- All processes are confirmed running with appropriate PIDs

## Ready for Performance Analysis

Your setup is now complete for performance checking via MCP Chrome DevTools! The MCP server has access to all Chrome DevTools features and can programmatically analyze the performance of your Snooker Score Board application.
